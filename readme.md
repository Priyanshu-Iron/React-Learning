# React Learning Projects

This repository showcases my journey of learning React.js through small projects. I am learning React from the [Scrimba platform](https://scrimba.com/), under the guidance of [Bob Ziroll](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobziroll/).

## Overview

React.js is a powerful library for building interactive user interfaces. To solidify my understanding of React concepts, I have worked on several hands-on projects that cover fundamental concepts such as state management, props, and component architecture.

## Projects

### 1. Travel Journal
🗺️ **Description**: A simple journal app to document travel experiences with titles, images, and descriptions.
- **Features**:
  - Dynamic rendering of travel entries
  - Integration of reusable components
  - Use of props to pass data
- **Key Concepts**: Props, component-based architecture, CSS styling

### 2. Sound Pads
🎵 **Description**: An interactive soundboard app where users can play different sounds by clicking on pads.
- **Features**:
  - Event handling for button clicks
  - Dynamic state updates
  - Audio integration
- **Key Concepts**: State management, event handling

### 3. Additional Projects
Here are some additional projects I plan to complete:
- 💼 **Digital Business Card**: A personal business card showcasing contact information and a brief bio.
- 😂 **Meme Generator**: A fun tool to create custom memes using image templates and text input.
- 🎲 **Tenzies Game**: A dice-based game to practice React hooks and state management.

## Technologies Used
- ⚛️ React.js
- 📜 JavaScript (ES6+)
- 🖼️ HTML
- 🎨 CSS

## Why Scrimba?
Scrimba offers an interactive learning experience, and Bob Ziroll's courses provide practical examples and clear explanations of React concepts. These projects help bridge the gap between theory and practical application.

## Next Steps
As I progress, I aim to build more complex applications and explore advanced React concepts, such as:
- 🌐 Context API
- 🛤️ React Router
- 🔧 Custom hooks
